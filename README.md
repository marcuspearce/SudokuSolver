# SudokuSolver

SudokuSolver is an iOS application which allows the user to input a custom sudoku board and receive a solution. It utilizes backtracking, a recursive algorithmic technique, to solve the puzzle. It is implemented using **Switft**. My motivation to create this project came after my parents were showing off that they were better in sudoku than me. It also served as a great opportunity to learn mobile app development, Switft, and UI Design.
